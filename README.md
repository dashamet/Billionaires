# Money, Money, Money

* `Billionaires1996-2014.dta` is the dataset I used from researchers Caroline Freund and Sarah Oliver at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. You can find their working paper and the zip-file with all of their datasets [here](https://piie.com/publications/working-papers/origins-superrich-billionaire-characteristics-database). 

* `Guide to Billionaires Characteristics Database.pdf` is a data dictionary of the files provided by the researchers and the variable names. 

* `Billionaires.Rmd` contains my code for the visualizations. It produces the HTML file `Billionaires.html`.
